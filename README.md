# Geometric_Algorithms
Algorithms implemented during third semester of computer science at AGH. (Geometry Algorithms course)
Jupyter notebooks are in Polish. We use graphic tools created by BIT AGH.

Kod_1 - positioning of point relative to straight line
Kod_2 - determine convex hull using Graham and Jarvis Algorithms
Kod_3 - polygon triangulation
Kod_4 - Line sweep algoritm for sections intersection
